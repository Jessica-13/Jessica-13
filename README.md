👋 Hi! I’m Jessica, a young creator passionate about writing ✍️, game design 🎮🎲, and art in all its forms 🎨

🌱 Graduated in Telecommunications Engineering, Services and Uses from INSA Lyon 🦏, I’m currently self-learning and developing my skills in video game and board game creation.
Every day, I discover how games can become powerful tools for learning, emotion, and transformation.

✨ What drives me is designing narrative and educational games that can move, inspire, and make people think.
I deeply believe in the power of play to learn in different ways and to create meaningful experiences 🍃

🚀 Curious, determined, and always eager to learn, I’m at the beginning of a journey I hope to build at the crossroads of technology, art, and humanity.

💬 Feel free to reach out! I’m always happy to learn from others and share ideas 🙂
